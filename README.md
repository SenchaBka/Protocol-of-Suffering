# Protocol of Suffering
Hey! This is Protocol of Suffering, a web-based game inspired by I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. It’s a dark, psychological game exploring intense themes about suffering and survival.

What’s This Project About?
We’re still working on the game, so it’s a bit of a work in progress, but the story and atmosphere are already pretty intense! The game mixes storytelling with gameplay that challenges you to make tough choices in a creepy world.

What Did We Use?
Python, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB

Built a full-stack web game with real-time communication using WebSockets

Integrated Google authentication for easy login

Connected MongoDB smoothly with third-party APIs to manage game data

How Can You Try It?
